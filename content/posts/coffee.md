'Coffee is not a addiction, it's a necessity'

This post is just about how I make coffee, Perfected it for nearly 2 years staying home during pandemic lmao...
So lets start ye

> Ingredients

- Coffee
  - I prefer nescafe, I heard rage coffee is really good, but any coffee which doesn't leave any residue would be fine
- Milk
- Sugar

This has three stages

1. Beat

   - Here we take 1 and half 'coffee spoon' of coffee with 1 and half coffee spoon of sugar (add as per your taste)
   - Add one coffeespoon of lukewarm water
   - And Beat the shit outta that mixture

2. Pour
   - While you are at it, boil the milk may be
   - Make sure the milky is little frothy
   - Pour the milk in the beaten mixture
3. Slurp
   - Primary rule while drinking coffee
     - we dont sip it, we slurp it
     - Here is an [article](https://latinamericancoffeeacademy.org/slurp-coffee/) why you should slurp your coffee
